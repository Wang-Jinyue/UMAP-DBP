# UMAP-DBP: An Improved DNA-Binding Proteins Prediction Method Based on Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projectio

DNA-binding proteins play a vital role in cellular processes. It is extremely urgent to develop a high-throughput method for efficiently identifying DNA-binding proteins. Some methods in the field of machine learning and deep learning show excellent computing speed and accuracy, which are worth trying to apply. In this work, we proposed a novel predictor, called UMAP-DBP. Firstly, the feature extraction of primary protein sequence was realized based on physicochemical distance transformation, profile-based Auto-cross covariance and General series correlation pseudo amino acid composition. Secondly, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and feature importance score methods were used for feature selection, there is a progressive relationship between them. Finally, the Adaboost operation engine and jackknife test was adopted for predicting DNA-binding proteins. For jackknife test over the BP1075 and BP594, we obtained an overall accuracy of 82.97% and 82.14%, Cohen's kappa (CK) of 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. The results illustrate that a feasible method has been developed for predicting DNA-binding proteins by UMAP and Adaboost. This is the first study in which UMAP has been successfully applied to identify DNA-binding proteins. All the data and code are accessible at https://github.com/Wang-Jinyue/UMAP-DBP.
